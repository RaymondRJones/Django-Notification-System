# Django-Notification-System

Project to practice some system design concepts like message queues and also build a useful tool that people pay like $600/year and up to $5000/year depending on the scale

# TO-DO

1. Deploy the app on Heroku (Likely need to ask for database payment)
I prefer Heroku over AWS for not needing to learn how to use HTTPS on AWS
2. Send out emails based on triggers of the newly created users
3. Daily check if a user was created with another user's referal code and send an email if so?
4. Track the loyalty points of a user
